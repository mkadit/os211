# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Paru: The Better AUR Helper and Pacman Wrapper for Arch Linux](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/paru-arch-linux#:~:text=Introduction%20to%20Paru,-The%20Arch%20User&text=It%20helps%20us%20automate%20the,and%20also%20resolve%20build%20dependencies.)
   An explanation about the new AUR helper paru, it was quite the news when one of the core developer for yay (another AUR helper) stepped away and create his own AUR helper. I got curious and look it up, this page quickly summed up the things I want to know

2. [owl4ce dotfile](https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles)
   It started when I got fed up in having to continuously to login to my guest account, when I'm on my main account (since my setups didn't carried around). To solve this I decided to change it around, but since I'm bored using tiling window manager (dwm) I decided to use openbox (since I don't really like DE like plasma or xfce). But I want it pretty, and I don't have time to tinker it, thankfully there are plenty of openbox configs inside a telegram group I joined. So I look around and decided to have owl4ce one since it looks good and easy to install since it uses rsync

3. [How To Use Rsync to Sync Local and Remote Directories Linux BasicsBackups](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories)
   I was quite curious about rsync since it managed to sync files from remote and local so neatly after the I installed owl4ce's dotfiles. So I looked it up and this site tells me plenty enough to get the big picture about it

4. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)
   So I just installed virtualbox and when I tried it there was a notice about a virtual memory when discussing about the space usage. I have no idea what it is, well the website explains well to me

5. [Copy on Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)
   On the slide it mentions something about copy on write. I was wondering what it was and began to search for it, well the website tells me what it actually is, a method to control the resources being used

6. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)
   I didn't know what paging have anything with memory management so I got curious when I saw it in the slide. I looked it up and found this website what is it, the algorithms, etc.

7. [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop)
   So we know that top can be used to monitor and kill processes. But it has a steep learning curve (even more than learning Vim), which is where this nice alternative htop comes in. It basically top but more colourful, more features, and doesn't have a steep learning curve to start using it

8. [Would adding more RAM increase my speed](https://askubuntu.com/questions/125154/would-adding-more-ram-increase-my-speed-in-ubuntu-and-how-hard-is-this-to-do#:~:text=Adding%20more%20RAM%20will%20increase,%3A%20the%20faster%20%3D%20the%20best.)
   When I tried to minimize the amount of ram I used I didn't really noticed any difference. I always thought more RAM means your computer becomes faster but it wasn't the case this time, so I got curious , look around and found this form that answers it

9. [Thrasing](http://www.thrashing.com/thrashing-in-computer-science.html)
So in the slide there was something called thrashing. I didn't know what that  word (that is so similar to trashing) means especially what roles it has in virtual memory. So I decided to look it up

10. [How to Configure IP Network with nmui](https://www.tecmint.com/nmtui-configure-network-connection/)
Lately my internet been on the jump, and the GUI application to configure it is faulty to a fault. I know it's possible to configure my network using the terminal but I didn't really want to learn it since I have other things to do, but I didn't really want to install another GUI application to just configure it. Turns out there's a nice curses-based interface for  the networkmanager package called nmtui, so I decided to check it out with this website
