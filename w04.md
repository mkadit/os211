# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [rmlint](https://github.com/sahib/rmlint)
   A script that quickly finds duplicated files and/or empty folders. This is an extremely useful thing as it can quickly find all of them, resulting a script for you to review which files and/or folders you want to delete. It saved me loads of storage, all just by using a single script.

2. [ncdu](https://github.com/rofl0r/ncdu)
   A TUI that quickly calculates the and sort folders according to their size. It certainly saved me eye from with it's easy to read interface (as well as GiBs of data hidden in the .local/share).

3. [rust-alternative](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/)
   Alternatives to the various commands usually found in a Unix based system written in rust. Some of them adds more colour while others improved their basic counterparts, fd and ripgrep being two whose performance outstrip find and grep respectively.
4. [Understanding Shared Libraries in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/understanding-shared-libraries-in-linux/)
   An explanation of what a library is, what libraries does Linux support, the categories of a dynamic or shared libraries, how to locate them, and manage them. It's a quite easy to understand guide with examples and samples of output that that shouldn't make you go off track.

5. [All About Linux Swap Space](https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/)
   A comprehensive explanation of what swapping is, how they work, why are they necessary, and how big should your swap space be. The page also gives you the commands needed to interact with said swaps such as seeing a swap space and how to add them. It also tells a little bit about the other form of swaps, swap file as well.

6. [Little and Big Endian Mystery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)
   An explanation of Endian, something you'll eventually encountered when discussing memories. The website tells you the difference between the two as well as gives you an example of them. Truth be told I didn't really understand why the big fuss about endian until I read this.

7. [Stack vs Heap: Know the Difference](https://www.guru99.com/stack-vs-heap.html#3)
   An explanation between the stack and heap memory. I was quite curious when I first learned the term, done a little bit GSGS and found this website that explains the two perfectly.

8. [Manual Memory Management vs Automatic Garbage Collection](http://www.hildstrom.com/projects/garbagecollection/index.html)
   People always said that manually managing memory will be more efficient for the program than letting a garbage collection do it but I never really understood by how much. This website (although not exactly the best looking) offers insights for my question (it even got charts and the programs written on it).

9. [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)
   All programs usually have ways to manage a computer's memory, either making the user manage it manually or letting a garbage collector handles it. Rust however provide an alternative by using what is known as ownership, managing said memory through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at a time. Confusing? Definitely. Fortunately the rust docs provide a detailed explanation of it.

10. [Embedding Lua in C](https://lucasklassmann.com/blog/2019-02-02-how-to-embeddeding-lua-in-c/)
   I was wondering what other applications could Lua be used other than for managing my neovim config. Look and behold, I've found this website that tells me how to embedded said language to C. I figured I tried it, it was a pain really.
