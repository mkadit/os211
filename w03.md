# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_systems)
   A website containing basic informations about file systems such as telling as the many types of file system, their journaling techniques, how to identify an existing file system, how to not only create but also mount and unmount them. A quite useful website when you decided to do a partition on your system, something I can attest to.

2. [What is a Journaling File System?](https://www.maketecheasier.com/journaling-in-file-system/)
   A website that informs us what is journaling in a way easy to understand. It also tells us a little bit more about the more well known file systems mainly about FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS. It gives enough knowledge while not being all too technical and boring.

3. [What's the Difference Between Fat32, exFAT, and NTFS?](https://www.howtogeek.com/235596/whats-the-difference-between-fat32-exfat-and-ntfs/)
   A website that explain about the three file systems often found, FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS. It tells us in which gadget would we likely found one of the three file system, it's compatibility, it's limits and it's ideal use. It sure did do the job of making me understand which filetype a device I had with me, making the process of flashing and partitioning smoother.

4. [Protection in File System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protection-in-file-system/)
   A website that tells us about a way to protect the files in the file system using access control. It did cleared up a few quesiton I have about users and their permission since I can't figure out an example of such usage.

5. [The Linux File System Structure Explained](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/the-linux-file-system-structure-explained)
   A website that tells us a quite comprehensive and at the same time easy to understand information about the file structure on linux. It peronally helped me why I couldn't access or write a file sometimes and makes changing things for the system and not only on the user a lot more easier. It also helps that thanks to it I can update the mirrors I needed for my package installer, and mount devices as well.

6. [Tar Command Tutorial with 10 Practical Examples](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/04/unix-tar-command-examples/)
   A website that shows a 10 examples of the commands you would most likely useful. It sure helps, particularly if you found the explanations found on manpage to be quite incomprehensible

7. [Arch Linux Fast Installer](https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi)
   A script that allows one to install the Arch Linux easily. I personally use this when I accidentally broke my OS during a few days before UAS.

8. [Arch Linux Desktop Environment Installer](https://github.com/MatMoul/archdi)
   If you installed Arch Linux for the first time, the thing bitter pill you swallow would be that there's nothing more other than a tty. This script provides an easy installation to install a desktop envrionment (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc). I personally tried this script when I first installed Arch Linux (since I was frustrated that it's not working, and since there's a deadline due tomorrows).

9. [Introduction to File Locking in Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/file-locking)
   A website containing informations and a few commnads to file locking, something that makes read or reading a file by multiple processes safely. Often time I would run multiple instance of a script and with it comes the occasional freezes. Thanks to this I don't need to really worry about that anymore (most of the time).

10. [How to Password-Protect Folders and Files in Linux](https://www.maketecheasier.com/password-protect-folders-files-linux/)
A website that explained how to protect your files and/or folders by giving them passwords. It's not encrypted but it should provide a reasonable security if your friend decided to be devious to snoop around (something I can testify).
